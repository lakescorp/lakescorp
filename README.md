# Lakescorp

Hello! I'm behind Lakescorp, a personal project fueled by my passion for technology and my ambition to offer unique services through apps and games. 

## 🎮 Apps & Games

I develop Android apps and games, available for you to explore on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store). Additionally, I create PC games which you can find on [Itch.io](https://itch.io/).

## 🤖 AI & Bots

I have a keen interest in artificial intelligence. One of my notable projects is the [Image Label Utility Tool](https://github.com/lakescorp/ImageLabelIA) which showcases this passion. I also develop bots, such as the [Ticket-bot-discord](https://github.com/lakescorp/Ticket-bot-discord), a message reactive Discord bot utilizing cogs.

## 💻 Coding

Programming is more than just a skill for me, it's a passion. Some of the software I develop is shared right here on my GitHub profile.

## 📌 About Me

Lakescorp represents the merging of my technological zeal with a drive to provide varied services via apps and games. I truly hope they pique your interest.
